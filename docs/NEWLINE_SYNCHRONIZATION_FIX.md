# Newline Synchronization Fix

## Problem Identified

When switching between the editor and preview steps, separate lines were being put on the same line. If the "Synchronize" button wasn't pressed, the preview images would preserve the previous newlines. However, when clicking the "Synchronize" button, it would take into account the missing newline characters between separate lines and generate new preview images with missing newline characters.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the text processing functions that handle conversion between plain text and HTML format used by the TipTap editor:

1. **`textToHtmlWithLineBreaks`**: Was filtering out empty lines and trimming content, causing loss of line structure
2. **`htmlToTextWithLineBreaks`**: Was over-normalizing line breaks and not preserving the original line structure properly

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `textToHtmlWithLineBreaks` Function
- **Before**: Filtered out empty lines and trimmed content, causing loss of line breaks
- **After**: Preserves all line breaks including consecutive ones by:
  - Not filtering out empty lines
  - Replacing empty lines with a single space to maintain HTML structure
  - Preserving leading/trailing spaces in lines

### 2. Enhanced `htmlToTextWithLineBreaks` Function
- **Before**: Over-normalized line breaks, causing loss of structure
- **After**: More conservative normalization by:
  - Only normalizing excessive line breaks (4+ consecutive) to triple breaks
  - Preserving most line break structures
  - Better handling of paragraph and line break conversion

### 3. Improved Content Reconstruction in BatchImageGenerator
- Added explicit content preservation check in the preview generation
- Ensures that text content maintains its line break structure when generating images

## Files Modified

1. **`src/lib/text-processing.ts`**
   - Enhanced `textToHtmlWithLineBreaks()` function
   - Enhanced `htmlToTextWithLineBreaks()` function

2. **`src/components/canvas/BatchImageGenerator.tsx`**
   - Improved content handling in image generation

3. **`src/lib/__tests__/newline-preservation.test.ts`** (new file)
   - Comprehensive test suite to verify newline preservation works correctly

## Test Results

All tests pass, confirming that:
- Single line breaks within paragraphs are preserved
- Paragraph breaks (double newlines) are preserved  
- Mixed line breaks and paragraphs work correctly
- Empty lines between content are handled properly
- Consecutive newlines are managed appropriately
- Edge cases with only newlines are handled gracefully
- HTML conversion maintains proper structure
- Bidirectional conversion (text â†” HTML) preserves content

## How It Fixes the Original Issue

1. **Editor to Preview**: When content is synchronized from the editor to the preview step, line breaks are now properly preserved through the text processing pipeline
2. **Synchronize Button**: Clicking "Synchronize" now correctly maintains the line structure instead of merging separate lines
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Whether the synchronize button is pressed or not, the line structure is maintained consistently

## Backward Compatibility

The changes are backward compatible and don't break existing functionality. The improvements are conservative and only affect line break preservation, not the core logic of content processing.
